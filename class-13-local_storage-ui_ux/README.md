### Announcements

- On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Sunday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it counts for 10% of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for multiple reasons:

	1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
	2. It is administered through a service called EdRepublic, and is actually their exam mechanism embedded in Canvas, so it is going to look and feel a little different. You've seen EdRepublic's content before, on the 201 entrance exam that you took.
	3. You only get one attempt at re-taking it if you do not pass the first time.

- An exam score of 80% or greater is required to pass the exam. Note that the final exam category in your course average is pass/fail: a score of 80% or greater gets you 100% of the points in that category. Thus, passing the exam will bump up your course average a bit.

- Do note, though, that you can (and definitely should!!!) still be resourceful and use books, Google, a REPL, whatever, to answer the questions. The exam is open-book. Life is open-book.

- Your quizzes are designed to help you prepare, so be sure to review them before the exam.

**Resubmission deadline**: The deadline for any late or resubmitted assignments is Sunday night (8/26), 11:59PM. Once we get into Project Week, your attention should be solely on your team and your project.

### Discussion on Final Projects

- Look at responses (so far) to the project ideas discussion in Canvas
- Overview of project assignment specifications
- Discuss process for selecting projects and setting teams
- FAQ
  - **Are all of the requirements firm?** (No, there is room for negotiation, but variances must be pre-approved)
  - **Can teams use API data?** (Generally no, there are ways to mock that up more in line with our  technical command at this point. That's covered extensively in 301)
  - **What can teams use outside of the good ole HTML, CSS, JS, etc.? Are there any approved libraries?** (It's easier to name the excluded libraries: jQuery, any CSS libraries/frameworks such as Bootstrap or Skeleton. It's OK to use other libraries or utilities like ChartJS, for instance, but we'll discuss them individually with each team as part of reviewing your project plan.)

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 13 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to understand concepts in persistence and the JavaScript commands needed to read/write to/from local storage, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate knowledge and command of JSON syntax and structure, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.
