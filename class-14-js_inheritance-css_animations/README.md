## UI & UX discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.

- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/)
- [10 Web design trends you can expect to see on websites in 2015](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/01/02/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2015/)
- [40 Stunning Website Designs with Great Color Schemes](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/10/25/40-stunning-website-designs-with-great-color-schemes/)
- [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/)
- [Seattle Times project on the Ehlwa River](https://github.com/seattletimes/elwha)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful. Find a design or layout you like and build something that mimics it. ALWAYS try to view your project from the perspective of someone who has never seen it before. Does the user need instructions? Are the user interactions clear to a new user?
