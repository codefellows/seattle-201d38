# Class 15: Looking to the Future: Code 301 Preview and Project Week

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

***The Code 301 entrance exam will be published later today. It will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday night. Allow yourself about an hour, maybe two if you are methodical, to complete it. Take your time, be run/test the code snippets, and kick its butt.***

## Schedule for Today

**9:00-10:15**

- Psychological Safety discussion with Brook Riggio, VP of Education
- Initial team meeting

**10:30: Lecture, Part 2: (ending by 11:45)** 

- Allie Grampa will visit and provide a preview of Code 301
- Questions/review on 201 topics?
- Discussion on final projects

**12:15: Pardner Power Hour**

- [The Impact of Impostor Syndrome, with Convoy](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-the-impact-of-imposter-syndrome-with-convoy-tickets-49224396495)

**1:00-???:** 

- Lab time. You will have an assignment to complete as a team (note: it'll only take an hour or so, tops), and then you can begin your project discussion and planning.
- Give Demi lots of pets.

**1:30**

- The Code 201 class that has been a week ahead of you will be doing their final presentations. You should watch as many of these as you can!

**Announcements**

  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today. As always, thank you for your feedback!
  - Starting at 9:00a on Monday morning is a blackout window on submitting classwork (including late assignments and any resubmissions) during Project Week. In other words, you should be **100%** focused on your project during Project Week. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - You'll have the weekend after project presentations to turn in any lingering late work or resubmissions. The deadline for that will be Sunday 9/2 at 11:59pm.
  - The instructional staff will go through gradebook and "zero out" any previously unsubmitted assignments today, including those with an outstanding due date. This is not punitive or permanent (you can still submit/resubmit!), just an administrative step to show you ongoing exactly where your grade stands if you do not submit any additional assignments or do any resubmits of previous assignments.
  - Note that during project week as you submit (or if you don't!) your daily project reports, your course grade will move up or down accordingly.

---

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.

## Readings

- No readings for today! But keep in mind it is time to start getting into the habit of doing regular daily reading of tech articles, Twitter feeds, and other resources. A great time to do this: on your commute if you bus or train or whatever. And if you drive, there's podcasts! Always Be Learning!
